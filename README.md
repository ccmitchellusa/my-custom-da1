# A simple deployable architecture ‚ú®

This simple deployable architecture provisions a fictitious environment suitable for a team starting a new project:
- a resource group üìÅ,
- a virtual private cloud üå§Ô∏è,
- access groups for administrators üîí, operators üïµÔ∏è and developers üíª.

> ‚ùó You will **require a paid account** to deploy this architecture.

This project is also based on the standard project template from the https://github.ibm.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-module-template repo, so it has integration with Make and a standard pipeline for building, testing and publishing the deployable architecture to a private catalog.
